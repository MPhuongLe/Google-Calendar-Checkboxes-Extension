# 🎉 Google Calendar Checkboxes Extension 🗓️✅

This **Chrome extension** adds checkboxes to **Google Calendar** events, making it easy to track your task completion with just a click! No more forgetting what’s done and what’s not.

## ✨ Features
- **Checkbox for every event** in Google Calendar.
- **Saves state** locally using `chrome.storage.local`, so your selections persist.
- **Three-step cycle** for tracking event progress:
  1. **⬜ Unchecked** → Default state.
  2. **✅ Checked** → Event completed (opacity reduces slightly).
  3. **❌ Crossed-out** → Event cancelled (opacity reduces further).

## 🔧 Installation
1. 📥 **Clone** or **download** this repository.
2. 🌐 Open **Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. 🛠️ Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle at the top right).
4. 📂 Click **Load Unpacked** and select the project folder.
5. 🎉 Open **Google Calendar** and enjoy the checkboxes!

## 🎯 How to Use
1. Click a **checkbox** to mark an event as **completed** (opacity reduces).
2. Click again to mark it as **cancelled** (crossed-out, more opacity reduction).
3. Click once more to **reset** it back to the default state.

## 🐞 Known Issues
- **Initial checkboxes may take a moment to appear** (minor delay due to page load time).
- **Checkbox states do not sync across devices** (local storage only).
